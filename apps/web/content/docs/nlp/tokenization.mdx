# Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens, which can be words, characters, or subwords. It's a fundamental preprocessing step in natural language processing.

## Why Tokenization Matters

Before any text analysis can be performed, we need to break the text into manageable pieces:

- Words are the most intuitive tokens for English and many other languages
- Characters might be more appropriate for languages without clear word boundaries
- Subword tokenization provides a balance between word and character tokenization

## Types of Tokenization

### Word Tokenization

Word tokenization splits text at word boundaries, usually indicated by whitespace and punctuation.

```python
def simple_word_tokenize(text):
    """A simple word tokenizer that splits on whitespace and removes punctuation."""
    # Remove punctuation and split by whitespace
    text = text.lower()
    for punct in ",.!?;:()[]{}\"'":
        text = text.replace(punct, " ")
    return text.split()

text = "Hello, world! This is a simple example."
tokens = simple_word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)  # ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'simple', 'example']
```

### Character Tokenization

Character tokenization breaks text into individual characters.

```python
def char_tokenize(text):
    """Tokenize text into characters."""
    return list(text)

text = "Hello!"
tokens = char_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)  # ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '!']
```

### Subword Tokenization

Subword tokenization algorithms like BPE (Byte Pair Encoding), WordPiece, and SentencePiece break words into smaller units based on frequency.

## Challenges in Tokenization

- Handling punctuation and special characters
- Dealing with contractions (e.g., "don't" â†’ "do" + "n't")
- Language-specific issues (e.g., compound words in German)
- Social media text with hashtags, emojis, and unconventional spellings

## Implementation

A more robust tokenizer would use regular expressions:

```python
import re

def better_word_tokenize(text):
    """A better word tokenizer using regular expressions."""
    # Define a pattern for words
    pattern = r'\b\w+\b'
    return re.findall(pattern, text.lower())

text = "Hello, world! This is a better example."
tokens = better_word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)  # ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'better', 'example']
```

In the next section, we'll explore how to use these tokens to build language models and analyze text.
