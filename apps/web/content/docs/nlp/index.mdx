# Welcome to ToyNLP

ToyNLP is a hands-on guide to learning natural language processing (NLP) from scratch. Our goal is to provide clear explanations and practical implementations to help you understand how computers process and analyze human language.

## What is Natural Language Processing?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. It focuses on the interaction between computers and human language, particularly how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.
