# Welcome to ToyRL

ToyRL is a hands-on guide to learning reinforcement learning (RL) from scratch. Our goal is to provide intuitive explanations and interactive implementations to help you understand this exciting field of machine learning.

## What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. Unlike supervised learning, the agent is not told which actions to take but must discover which actions yield the highest reward through trial and error.

## Core Components of RL

1. **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker
2. **Environment**: What the agent interacts with
3. **State**: The current situation of the agent
4. **Action**: A move the agent can make
5. **Reward**: Feedback from the environment
6. **Policy**: The agent's strategy for selecting actions
